A very basic Gravio.com Action File to set the color of the Gravio Light

[Gravio is an IoT Edge Computing Platform](https://www.gravio.com) to create IoT 
applications with ease. Gravio works with so called "Actions" that can be triggered 
by sensors such as buttons, thermometers, range detectors, magnet sensors, 
vibration sensors, PIR sensors, CO2 sensors etc. 

Actions are JSON files with the `.acs` ending and can imported straight into Gravio's
Action Editor.
